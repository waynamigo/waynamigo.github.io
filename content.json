Unfortunately, the current Internet architecture cannot meet the increasing demands of these end-users, and the architecture of current Internet appears to be ossification. Network virtualization technique has been propounded as one of the important techniques to fend off the Internet ossification. Through the technique of network virtualization, Service Providers (SPs) can provide different services for different users by means of sliceable management of the existing substrate network resources, and can improve the resource utilization of substrate network and reduce the wasting of substrate network resources. Virtual network embedding is the core component of the network virtualization, it concerns mainly on the allocation of substrate resources and it leads to the virtual network embedding algorithm to be a hotspot of the research.Due to the fact that the problem of virtual network embedding is proved to be an NP-hard problem, therefore, domestic and overseas scholars have proposed some of heuristic algorithms to address this issue or carried out the simulation under the small scale of network topology using the optimization tools. As mentioned earlier, the issue of virtual network embedding is a multi-objective optimization problem. It involves how to maximize the revenue of InPs, how to minimize the cost of accommodating virtual network requests, how to minimize the energy consumption of servers and equipment, and how to balance the workload of substrate networks. However, the prior studies concentrated primarily on the maximization of revenue by accommodating more virtual network requests or increasing the network resource utilization through optimizing virtual link mapping solutions. Fortunately,some researchers begin to study the energy-aware and security-aware virtual network embedding algorithms. In the subsequent section, we will introduce these two kinds of virtual network embedding algorithms. In recent years, energy-aware virtual network embedding algorithms [1–5] have received considerable attention because the power consumption of an average data center is the same as 25,000 households [6] and it is becoming the major energy cost of network operators which almostly account for 42% of the total operating costs. In addition, the security vulnerabilities caused by network virtualization technologies have been attracted great attention from researchers. The security-aware virtual network embedding algorithms have been deeply investigated in the literature of [7–11]. The issues of network fragmentation and load balance can affect the acceptance ratio of VN requests and the Quality of Services (QoS) of the networks, and can equally affect the revenue of SPs since some high level customers are willing to pay the extra price for high quality of services.However, these aforementioned algorithms involve two objective optimization. Therefore, there are some room for improvement by consideration more objectives on virtual network embedding algorithms. The main difference between our paper and previous works is that we take into consideration of energy consumption and load balance into virtual network embedding. This involves three objective optimization including revenue/cost, energy consumption and load balance, since our work is on the foundation of the classical heuristic algorithm which is the default consideration of revenue/cost. In our work, we investigated the multi-objective virtual network embedding algorithms,especially studied the energy and load balance aware virtual network embedding algorithm. Specifically, we first incorporate the node resource utilization and node energy consumption into the node ranking method aiming to give a comprehensive node ranking approach during the node mapping process. Then we utilize an improved differentiated pricing strategy with the purpose of selecting the substrate path with the minimum link consumption for virtual links. Finally, we take into account the node resource utilization to balance the node load in the node mapping stage, and adopt the improved differentiated pricing strategy for assigning different weights to different virtual links to balance the link load in the link mapping stage. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: We introduce a comprehensive node ranking approach based on node available resource, node resource utilization and node energy consumption. The node ranking method not only takes into account the node energy consumption, but also takes the node resource utilization into consideration. We leverage an improved differentiated pricing strategy to set different weights for different substrate links according to their bandwidth resource utilizations with the purpose of balancing the link load of substrate network, and employ the shortest path algorithm aiming at selecting the substrate path with the minimum link consumption for each virtual link from VNRs to perform the link mapping procedure. We conduct extensive simulations and evaluate our proposed algorithm compared with the other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of the acceptance ratio of VNRs, the long-term average revenue, the revenue to cost ratio, the standard deviation of node resource usage ratio, and the standard deviation of link resource usage ratio. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly review the related works that associated with multi-objective virtual network embedding issues. We describe the system model and problem statement in Section 3. In Section 4, we elaborate our proposed algorithm E-LB-VNE in details. Experimental results and analysis are illustrated in Section 5. Section 6 concludes this paper. 翻译随着科学技术的进步，许多互联网终端用户需要在现有网络架构上部署新协议或安装新服务。不幸的是，当前的互联网架构无法满足这些终端用户日益增长的需求，而当前互联网的架构似乎是僵化。网络虚拟化技术已被提出作为抵御互联网僵化的重要技术之一。通过网络虚拟化技术，服务提供商（SP）可以通过现有基板网络资源的可切片管理为不同用户提供不同的服务，可以提高基板网络的资源利用率，减少基板网络资源的浪费。虚拟网络嵌入是网络虚拟化的核心组成部分，它主要关注基板资源的分配，导致虚拟网络嵌入算法成为研究的热点。由于虚拟网络嵌入问题被证明是NP难问题，因此国内外学者提出了一些启发式算法来解决这个问题，或者在小规模的网络拓扑中进行仿真。优化工具。如前所述，虚拟网络嵌入问题是一个多目标优化问题。它涉及如何最大化InP的收入，如何最小化容纳虚拟网络请求的成本，如何最小化服务器和设备的能耗，以及如何平衡基板网络的工作量。然而，先前的研究主要集中在通过优化虚拟链路映射解决方案来容纳更多虚拟网络请求或增加网络资源利用率来最大化收入。幸运的是，一些研究人员开始研究能量感知和安全感知虚拟网络嵌入算法。在接下来的部分中，我们将介绍这两种虚拟网络嵌入算法。 近年来，能量感知虚拟网络嵌入算法[1-5]受到了广泛的关注，因为平均数据中心的功耗与25,000个家庭相同[6]，并且它正成为网络运营商的主要能源成本。几乎占总运营成本的42％。此外，网络虚拟化技术带来的安全漏洞也引起了研究人员的高度重视。在[7-11]的文献中深入研究了安全感知虚拟网络嵌入算法。网络分片和负载均衡的问题会影响VN请求的接受率和网络的服务质量（QoS），并且同样会影响SP的收入，因为一些高级客户愿意支付额外的高价格服务质量。然而，这些上述算法涉及两个客观优化。因此，通过考虑虚拟网络嵌入算法的更多目标，存在一些改进的空间。我们的论文与以前的工作之间的主要区别在于我们将能耗和负载平衡考虑到虚拟网络嵌入中。这包括三个客观优化，包括收入/成本，能源消耗和负载平衡，因为我们的工作是经典启发式算法的基础，这是收入/成本的默认考虑因素。在我们的工作中，我们研究了多目标虚拟网络嵌入算法，特别研究了能量和负载平衡感知虚拟网络嵌入算法。具体来说，我们首先将节点资源利用率和节点能耗纳入节点排序方法，旨在在节点映射过程中提供全面的节点排序方法。然后，我们利用改进的差异化定价策略，目的是选择虚拟链路的最小链路消耗的基板路径。最后，我们考虑节点资源利用率来平衡节点映射阶段的节点负载，并采用改进的差异化定价策略为不同的虚拟链路分配不同的权重，以平衡链路映射阶段的链路负载。 本文的主要贡献可归纳如下：1.我们引入了基于节点可用资源，节点资源利用率和节点能耗的综合节点排序方法。节点排序方法不仅考虑节点能耗，还考虑节点资源利用率。2.我们利用改进的差异化定价策略，根据其带宽资源利用率为不同的基板链路设置不同的权重，以平衡基板网络的链路负载， p2-related worksIn recent years, the problem of virtual network embedding has received considerable attention from domestic and overseas researchers.However, most of previous studies do not consider it to be a multiobjective optimization problem while at most do a tradeoff between two objectives. The main goal of prior work with single objective is to maximize the revenue of SPs by accommodating more virtual network requests and reducing the bandwidth utilization of substrate links [12–16]. The main drawback of these single-objective algorithms is thatthey did not realize the issue of virtual network embedding is a multi-objective problem, since a large amount of energy consumption can lead to reducing the overall revenue for ISPs, high quality of QoS willincrease the extra incomes of ISPs. To address these issues, two-objective virtual network embedding algorithms attract great attention from many researchers. The most representatives of these algorithms with two objectives are energy aware virtual network embedding algorithms, security aware virtual network embedding algorithms, and load balance aware virtual network embedding algorithms. 翻译近年来，虚拟网络嵌入问题受到国内外研究者的广泛关注。然而，大多数先前的研究并不认为它是多目标优化问题，而最多只是在两个目标之间进行权衡。单个目标的先前工作的主要目标是通过容纳更多的虚拟网络请求和降低基板链路的带宽利用来最大化SP的收入[12-16]。这些单目标算法的主要缺点是他们没有意识到虚拟网络嵌入问题是一个多目标问题，因为大量的能耗会导致ISP的整体收入减少，高质量的QoS将会增加ISP的额外收入。为了解决这些问题，双目标虚拟网络嵌入算法引起了许多研究者的极大关注。具有两个目标的这些算法的最多代表是能量感知虚拟网络嵌入算法，安全感知虚拟网络嵌入算法和负载平衡感知虚拟网络嵌入算法。 p2.1-energy aware VNE algorithmsDue to the exponentially growing amount of physical machines for service provisioning in data centers, the energy consumption caused by a large amount of servers has been becoming a crucial issue, and it hasattracted significant attention in recent years.Two approaches with two objectives that heuristic-based algorithm and particle-swarm-optimization-based algorithm are presented in [2], the authors traded off between energy consumption that is consumedby supporting VN requests and revenue that obtained from accommodating VN requests, and proposed an energy cost model and formulated the energy-aware virtual network embedding problem as aninteger linear programming problem. The authors formulated a discrete-time model to capture the concrete values of electricity price to deal with electricity price fluctuation issue, classified the substratenodes into active nodes and inactive nodes, and separated the substrate nodes into host nodes that can be running some computing tasks and router nodes that only perform forwarding tasks so as to furtherquantify the server energy consumption. However, the formulated mathematical model is based on the experimental simulation system, it cannot reflect the genuine network environments.The power consumption that is consumed by data centers can be decomposed of three parts: the first part is the communication energy consumption that is consumed by substrate links, the second part is theserver energy consumption that is consumed by substrate nodes, and the third part is the other energy consumption that caused by cooling and power distribution systems. In the literature of [1], the authorsformulated a power-efficient VN provisioning issue into a mixed integer linear programming problem to address the first two parts of energy consumption problems. The contributions of this paper is to give therefinement of communication energy consumption by means of modeling the substrate links as wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) network which is much closer to the genuine network environments,and employed an improved differentiated pricing strategy for choosing the routing paths. The proposed framework achieved a better tradeoff between the energy consumption and the blocking ratio of virtualnetwork requests. However, the disadvantage of this paper is that the proposed algorithm is based on two steps which cannot coordinate the two mapping stages, the main improvements lies in the improved dif-ferentiated pricing strategy in the link mapping stage while ignoring the enhancement of node mapping algorithm for facilitating the subsequent link mapping, and it can be further improved and intensified.The author of [4] proposed a memetic multi-objective energy aware virtual network embedding algorithm, in this paper, the author formulated an energy-aware virtual network embedding model and devised some of metrics for evaluating the embedding algorithms. This paper proposed a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm to do a tradeoff among all of the optimization objectives, used the local search technique to accelerate the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Extensive simulations shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other existing algorithms in terms of increasing revenue and decreasing energy consumption. Nevertheless, the suggested algorithm does not consider the communication energy consumption that is consumed by substrate links.The main differences between the work [1] and our work are summarized as follows. The first difference is that our proposed algorithm takes into consideration of both energy consumption and load balance. The second difference is that our method improved the differentiated pricing strategy with an aim to avoid link bandwidth resource bottleneck issue. The third difference is that our method adopts the genuine model to formulate the substrate link energy consumption. p2.2-load balance aware VNE algorithmsThe load balance issue is an important aspect of virtual network embedding problems apart from the issues of revenue and energy consumption. The unbalanced workload in the substrate network can lead to the decreasing quality of services and quality of user experience (QoE) which does not guarantee that the offered services comply with the prescribed service level agreements (SLAs). In this section, wesummarize the load balance aware virtual network embedding approaches.Li et al. [17] suggested a virtual network embedding algorithm from the perspective of load balance with diverse virtual network requests. In their studies, they computed the node link resource ratio and link node resource ratio of substrate network using the available resource on substrate nodes and substrate links, and computed the node link resource ratio and link node resource ratio of virtual networks using the demand requirements of virtual nodes and virtual links. In the node mapping stage, they choose substrate node with the node link resource ratio is closest to the node link resource ratio of virtual node. In the link mapping stage, they choose substrate link with the link node resource ratio is closest to the link node resource ratio of virtual link. Extensive simulation demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher acceptance ratio, revenue, and the state of load balancing.The authors of [18] presented an energy-aware virtual network embedding heuristic algorithm in their studies. They used a balancing factor to tradeoff between CPU resource of nodes and bandwidth resource of adjacent links for measuring the node importance. The proposed algorithm is based on the principle of energy consumption optimization and coordination between node mapping and link mapping, a comprehensive node ranking method is presented with the purpose of reducing the energy consumption and increasing the acceptance ratio.Aim at achieving the simultaneous load balancing of the substrate node and the substrate link, Huang [19] formulated a mathematical model of virtual network embedding problem which constrained by the number of hops, and proposed a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm called LB-PSO to solve it, the proposed algorithm has significantly increased the acceptance ratio and resource utilization.In the study of [20], the authors formulated an integer linear programming model for the fragmentation-aware virtual network embedding problem for the first time, and carried out some simulations in three different scenarios to indicate that their algorithm outperforms the other existing algorithms. p3-system model and problem statement公式整理待更新 p4-the proposed algorithmp5-evaluation resultsp6-conclusion物理网络资源（指民用网络）的能耗 由于网络用户急速增长的原因而大幅增加。另外它还会导致不平衡的基础网络的负载的超重部分，并减少（virtual network

不管网络层使用的是什么协议,在实际网络的链路上传送数据帧时,最终还是必须使用硬件地址。 ARP 高速缓存 (ARPcache),里面有所在的局域网上的各主机和路由器的 IP 地址到硬件地址的映射表。格式 &lt; IP address;MAC address;TTL &gt; TTL (Time To Live):地址映射有效时间 。 12345存放最近获得的 IP 地址到 MAC 地址的绑定,以减少 ARP 广播的数量。为了减少网络上的通信量,主机 A 在发送其ARP请求分组时,就将自己的 IP 地址到硬件地址的映射写入 ARP 请求分组。当主机 B 收到 A 的 ARP 请求分组时,就将主机 A的这一地址映射写入主机 B 自己的 ARP高速缓存中。这对主机 B 以后向 A 发送数据报时就更方便了。 ARP请求分组包含发送方硬件地址 / 发送方IP 地址/目标方硬件地址(未知时填 0)/ 目标方IP 地址。 本地广播 ARP 请求 ARP 响应分组 包含发送方硬件地址/发送方IP地址/目标方硬件地址/目标方 IP 地址。 IP数据报分片数据报字段格式 转发过程：根据IP数据报的目的地址就可以确定下一跳路由器分组转发算法12345678910(1) 从数据报的首部提取目的主机的 IP 地址 D, 得出目的网络地址为 N。(2) 若网络 N 与此路由器直接相连,则把数据报直接交付目的主机D;否则是间接交付,执行(3)。(3) 若路由表中有目的地址为 D 的特定主机路由,则把数据报传送给路由表中所指明的下一跳路由器;否则,执行(4)。(4) 若路由表中有到达网络 N 的路由,则把数据报传送给路由表指明的下一跳路由器;否则,执行(5)。(5) 若路由表中有一个默认路由,则把数据报传送给路由表中所指明的默认路由器;否则,执行(6)。(6)

无分类编址 CIDR，IP地址 ::= {&lt;网络前缀&gt;, &lt;主机号&gt;},中间使用符号‘/’来表示网络前缀构成超网路由聚合 有利于减少路由器之间选择的次数，从而提高性能。 CIDR记法 0 可以省略 最长前缀匹配原因：使用 CIDR 时,路由表中的每个项目由“网络前缀”和“下一跳地址”组成。在查找路由表时可能会得到不止一个匹配结果方案：在匹配结果中选择最长网络前缀的路由。

RIP(1)仅和相邻路由器交换信息。(2)交换的信息是当前本路由器所知道的全部信息,即自己的路由表。(3)按固定的时间间隔交换路由信息,例如,每隔30秒。当网络拓扑发生变化时,路由器也及时向相邻路由器通告拓扑变化后的路由信息。 隧道技术 在 IPv6 数据报要进入IPv4网络时,把 IPv6 数据报封装成为 IPv4 数据报,整个的 IPv6 数据报变成了 IPv4 数据报的数据部分。 当 IPv4 数据报离开 IPv4 网络中的隧道时,再把数据部分(即原来的 IPv6 数据报)交给主机的 IPv6 协议栈。 NAT技术 网络地址转换(Network Address Translation)解决：在专用网上使用专用地址的主机如何与互联网上的主机通信(并不需要加密)的问题 123456789内部主机 A 用本地地址 IP A 和互联网上主机 B 通信所发送的数据报必须经过 NAT 路由器。NAT 路由器将数据报的源地址 IP A 转换成全球地址IP G ,并把转换结果记录到NAT地址转换表中,目的地址 IP B 保持不变,然后发送到互联网。NAT 路由器收到主机 B 发回的数据报时,知道数据报中的源地址是 IP B 而目的地址是 IP G 。根据 NAT 转换表,NAT 路由器将目的地址 IP G 转换为IP A ,转发给最终的内部主机 A。","categories":[{"name":"复习","slug":"复习","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/复习/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"网络原理物理层链路层复习","slug":"2019-01-05-物理层链路层","date":"2019-07-13T16:20:46.363Z","updated":"2019-03-03T11:57:46.414Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/07/14/2019-01-05-物理层链路层/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2019/07/14/2019-01-05-物理层链路层/","excerpt":"","text":"物理层屏蔽双绞线

自由空间称为“非导引型传输媒体”。短波通信（即高频通信）主要是靠【电离层】的反射，但短波信道的通信质量较差，传输速率低微波在空间主要是直线传播 传统微波：地面微波接力通信 、卫星通信 宽带接入技术：有线宽带接入 无线宽带接入 非对称数字用户线 ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) 技术12345678910用数字技术对现有的模拟电话用户线进行改造，使它能够承载宽带业务特点：上行和下行带宽做成不对称的(上行指从用户到 ISP，而下行指从 ISP 到用户)。ADSL 在用户线（铜线）的两端各安装一个ADSL 调制解调器。我国目前采用的方案是离散多音调 DMT (Discrete Multi-Tone)调制技术。（这里的“多音调”就是【“多载波”或“多子信道”】的意思。DMT 调制技术采用【频分复用】的方法ADSL 采用【自适应调制技术】使用户线能够传送尽可能高的数据率，但【不能保证固定的数据率】第二代ADSL【无缝速率自适应技术 SRA (Seamless Rate Adaptation)】HFC网使用【模拟光纤技术】【电缆调制解调器】是为【 HFC 网】而使用的调制解调器 数据链路层链路层使用的信道 :点对点信道、广播信道链路&lt;通路 1234数据（逻辑）链路 (data link) 除了【物理线路】外，还必须有【通信协议】来控制这些数据的传输。若把实现这些协议的硬件和软件加到链路上，就构成了数据链路。现在最常用的方法是使用适配器（即网卡）来实现这些协议的硬件和软件。一般的适配器都包括了【数据链路层和物理层】这两层的功能。 数据链路层协议要解决的基本问题【封装成帧】【透明传输】【差错控制】 ①封装成帧，在一段数据的前后分别添加首部和尾部，然后就构成了一个帧。作用：确定帧的界限【帧定界】。—帧定界符SOH_DATA_EOT（end of transmission） ②透明传输：如果数据中的某个字节的二进制代码恰好和SOH或EOT一样数据链路层就会错误地“找到帧的边界” 123456解决方法：【字节填充 (byte stuffing)】或【字符填充(character stuffing)】。 1发送端的数据链路层在数据中出现控制字符“SOH”或“EOT”的前面插入一个转义字符“ESC”(其十六进制编码是 1B)。2接收端的数据链路层在将数据送往网络层之前删除插入的转义字符3如果转义字符也出现在数据当中，那么应在转义字符前面插入一个转义字符 ESC。当接收端收到连续的两个转义字符时，就删除其中前面的一个 ③差错检测：在传输过程中可能会产生比特差错：1 可能会变成 0 而 0 也可能变成 1在一段时间内，传输错误的比特占所传输比特总数的比率称为【误码率 BER (Bit Error Rate)】。 循环冗余检验CRC计算冗余码，余数作为FCS【帧检验序列】 CRC 是一种常用的检错方法，而 FCS 是添加在数据后面的冗余码。 FCS 可以用 CRC 这种方法得出，但 CRC 并不是获得 FCS 的唯一方法 “无比特差错”与“无传输差错”是不同的概念。 (1) 若得出的余数 R = 0，则判定这个帧没有差错，就接受 (accept)。 (2) 若余数 R！=0，则判定这个帧有差错，就丢弃。数据链路层的CRC检验可以实现【无比特差错】， 但是【不可靠传输】【不能确定是哪个比特出了差错】，只能做到【无差错接受】（无比特差错）要做到“可靠传输”（即发送什么就收到什么）就必须再加上【确认和重传机制】 PROTOCAL PPP(Point-to-Point Protocol)协议】点对点协议（包含了物理层和ip层的内容） 【面向字节，以字节为单位】 【一个将 IP 数据报封装到串行链路的方法】 【链路控制协议 LCP (Link Control Protocol)】 【网络控制协议 NCP (Network Control Protocol)】 【同步传输时，采用硬件完成【比特填充】，零比特传输：五个连续的1就填入一个0，接收时删除】 【异步传输时，使用特殊的字符填充法】MAC帧格式 PROTOCAL CSMA/CD局域网具有如下主要优点： 【具有广播功能】，从一个站点可很方便地访问全网。局域网上的主机可共享连接在局域网上的各种硬件和软件资源。 【便于系统的扩展和逐渐地演变】，各设备的位置可灵活调整和改变。
